<p>In this post I will introduce a project under <a href="http://code.google.com/p/unhaddins">Unofficial NHibernate Addins</a> named ComponentBehaviors. The goal of this project is to inject some goodness of System.ComponentModel through a dynamic proxy framework.</p>  <h1>The WHY</h1>  <p>Sometimes you need to implement certain interfaces of ComponentModel, for various reasons such as DataBinding, but the code need to accomplish this is tedious and repetitive. This code is called &quot;plumbing code&quot;, an the following snippet is an example:</p>  <pre class="brush: csharp;">public class Customer : BaseEntity
{
    private string _firstName;
    public virtual string FirstName
    {
        get { return _firstName; }
        set
        {
            if(!_firstName.Equals(value))
            {
                _firstName = value;
                OnPropertyChanged(&quot;FirstName&quot;);
            }
        }
    }

    private string _lastName;
    public virtual string LastName
    {
        get { return _lastName; }
        set
        {
            if(!_lastName.Equals(value))
            {
                _lastName = value;    
                OnPropertyChanged(&quot;LastName&quot;);
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>In the above sample, a property declaration took me 12 lines of code. Why I can't use auto properties (1 line)?</p>

<p>My goal was to have the same functionality like the above but with the following code:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp; ">public class Customer
{
    public virtual string FirstName {get; set;}
    public virtual string LastName {get; set;}
}

//Somewhere

configuration.For&lt;Customer&gt;()
    .Add&lt;NotifiableBehavior&gt;()
    .Add&lt;DataErrorInfoBehavior&gt;()
    .Add&lt;EditableBehavior&gt;();</pre>

<p>A side effect is that classes are not tied to those interfaces and can be used in another project.</p>

<h1>The WHAT</h1>

<p>By now there are three supported behaviors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DataErrorInfoBehavior </li>

  <li>EditableBehavior </li>

  <li>NotifyPropertyChangedBehavior </li>
</ul>

<h3>DataErrorInfo Behavior</h3>

<p>The DataErrorInfo behavior is based on the interface <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.idataerrorinfo.aspx">IDataErrorInfo</a>, and is described by me in this <a href="http://jfromaniello.blogspot.com/2009/09/howto-display-validations-errors-in.html">post</a>. The configuration is as follows:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp; ">configuration.For&lt;Customer&gt;()
.Add&lt;DataErrorInfoBehavior&gt;();</pre>

<p>You need to plug in your container an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/unhaddins/source/browse/trunk/uNhAddIns/uNhAddIns.Adapters/IEntityValidator.cs">IEntityValidator</a>, fortunately we have four implementations in uNhAddIns: </p>

<ul>
  <li>NHibernate Validator </li>

  <li>DataAnnotations </li>

  <li>Application Validation Block </li>

  <li>Castle Validations </li>
</ul>

<p>You can read more in this <a href="http://fabiomaulo.blogspot.com/2009/10/oss-has-users-commercial-products-has.html">post</a> of Fabio Maulo.</p>

<p>IDataErrorInfo is described in MSDN :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Provides the functionality to offer custom error information that a user interface can bind to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost any DataBinding infrastructures such as Asp.Net, Asp.Net MVC, Winforms and WPF supports binding to an IDataErrorInfo entity.</p>

<h3>Editable Behavior</h3>

<p>The Editable behavior is based on the interface <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.ieditableobject.aspx">IEditableObject</a>. The goal of this behavior is described in MSDN as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Provides functionality to commit or rollback changes to an object that is used as a data source.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Note: Commit or Rollback refers to in-memory operations. Not database. </em></p>

<p>So a test like this, is self-explanatory:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp; ">[Test]
public void session_shouldnot_be_dirty_after_cancelchanges()
{
    var id = CreateNewAlbum();
    using (ISession session = sessions.OpenSession())
    using (ITransaction tx = session.BeginTransaction())
    {
        var album = session.Get&lt;Album&gt;(id);
        ((IEditableObject) album).BeginEdit();
        album.Title = &quot;Dark side of the moon&quot;;
        ((IEditableObject) album).CancelEdit();
        session.IsDirty().Should().Be.False();

        tx.Commit();
    }
}</pre>

<h3>NotifyPropertyChanged behavior</h3>

<p>NotifyPropertyChanged behavior is based on the interface <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.inotifypropertychanged.aspx">INotifyPropertyChanged</a> and is very well described in the MSDN:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The INotifyPropertyChanged interface is used to notify clients, typically binding clients, that a property value has changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>The WHERE</h1>

<p>With uNhAddIns.ComponentBehaviors you define the behaviors of a class <strong><u>ONCE</u></strong> and you can get an entity with the behaviors in many ways. I will describe in this section how ComponentBehaviors works with NHibernate.</p>

<h3>Transient Entities</h3>

<p>We just need an IEntityFactory in our projects as follows:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp; ">public class EntityFactory : IEntityFactory
{
    private readonly IComponentProxyFactory _componentProxyFactory;

    public EntityFactory(IComponentProxyFactory componentProxyFactory)
    {
        _componentProxyFactory = componentProxyFactory;
    }

    public T CreateInstance&lt;T&gt;()
    {
        return (T) _componentProxyFactory.GetEntity(typeof (T));
    }
}</pre>

<p>Just plug that in your container and now you will be able to inject an IEntityFactory in your services.</p>

<h3>Persisted entities</h3>

<p>There are two ways to tell NHibernate that every time we return an object, this must come with the behaviors. The first way is with an interceptor as follows:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp; ">nhibernateConfig.Interceptor = 
    container.Resolve&lt;ComponentBehaviorInterceptor&gt;();</pre>

<p>The second is has a little overhead because it involves to inject your entities in the container and now I'm using vaguely. But you can read more in this <a href="http://fabiomaulo.blogspot.com/2008/11/entities-behavior-injection.html">thread</a>. </p>

<h3>Proxy entities</h3>

<p>With the steps described in the previous section, whenever nhibernate return an object, this object will come with the behaviors. But what happen when NHibernate itself need to generate a proxy for lazyloading stuff? Well, we can even specify that we want our behaviors in those proxies.</p>

<p>And the configuration is very easy:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp; ">cfg.Properties[Environment.ProxyFactoryFactoryClass] = 
    typeof (ComponentProxyFactoryFactory)
        .AssemblyQualifiedName</pre>

<p>&#160;</p>

<h1>Final thoughts </h1>

<p>If you want to see a working applications that use those concepts, have a look to this <a href="http://code.google.com/p/unhaddins/source/browse/#svn/trunk/Examples/uNHAddIns.Examples.WPF">example</a>. </p>

<p>I’ve started this project because I need it for my job, this was my first serious experience developing open source and for me has been very positive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve talked with lot of people around the globe, open source developers or not. </li>

  <li>Some of them are using the library and improving. </li>

  <li>I’ve learned a lot of Castle DynamicProxy and NHibernate. </li>

  <li>I’ve participated in the afore mentioned projects. </li>

  <li>I’ve three new job offers. </li>
</ul>

<h3>A word about NHibernate</h3>

<p>For me, one of the interesting things that I found in NHibernate is a lot of “extensions points”. You could plug whatever you want and radically change the behavior of the tool to fit your needs. </p>

<p>Enjoy the NHibernate injection. :-)</p>

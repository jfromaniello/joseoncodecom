<p>I am doing some experiments with the <a href="https://github.com/thecodejunkie/Nancy">Nancy</a> and let me say that it looks pretty neat so far. This is an experiment about content negotiation.</p>  <p>Content negotiation is defined in wikipedia as:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><i>Content negotiation is a mechanism defined in the HTTP specification that makes it possible to serve different versions of a document (or more generally, a resource) at the same URI, so that user agents can specify which version fit their capabilities the best.</i></p> </blockquote>  <p>This is something that will be supported in Nancy in future versions automatically. And even you will be able to override the behavior.</p>  <p>So far you can do something like:</p>  <pre class="brush: csharp; wrap-line: false;">public class SampleModule : NancyModule
{
    public SampleModule()
    {
        Get[&quot;example&quot;, c =&gt; c.Request.Accept(&quot;application/xml&quot;)] =
            a =&gt; Response.AsXml(&quot;hello xml&quot;);

        Get[&quot;example&quot;, c =&gt; c.Request.Accept(&quot;application/json&quot;)] =
            a =&gt; Response.AsJson(&quot;hello json&quot;);
    }
}</pre>

<p>The Accept method is an extension method as follows:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp; wrap-line: false;">public static class RequestHelper
{
    public static bool Accept(this Request request, string contentType)
    {
        return request.Headers.ContainsKey(&quot;Accept&quot;) 
            &amp;&amp; request.Headers[&quot;Accept&quot;]
                        .Any(c =&gt; c.Contains(contentType));
    }
}</pre>

<p>This might seem an overhead for simple cases like Xml/Json but it opens the door for cases like rest versioning. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cibrax/archive/2010/11/19/versioning-rest-services-with-wcf-http-processors.aspx">I took this example from my friend (and now coworker) Pablo Cibraro</a>.</p>

<p>For this example we have two different media types:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp; wrap-line: false;">public static class MediaTypes
{
  public const string Version1 
        = &quot;application/vnd.mycompany.myapp+xml&quot;;

  public const string Version2 
        = &quot;application/vnd.mycompany.myapp-v2+xml&quot;;
}</pre>

<p>And then we need to respond with two different representations of our Customer resource for each media type. One of them has address and the other one doesnt:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp; wrap-line: false;">public class SampleModule : NancyModule
{
    public SampleModule()
    {
        Get[&quot;customer/{id}&quot;, c =&gt; c.Request.Accept(MediaTypes.Version1)] =
            a =&gt; Response.AsXml(new Customer{ Name = &quot;Sideshow Bob&quot; });

        Get[&quot;customer/{id}&quot;, c =&gt; c.Request.Accept(MediaTypes.Version2)] =
            a =&gt; Response.AsJson(new CustomerV2
                                      { 
                                        Name = &quot;Sideshow Bob&quot; 
                                        Addresses = { {&quot;State Prison&quot;} }
                                      });
    }
}</pre>

<p>This show some of the power of Nancy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The delegate to select the handler is separated from the handler itself. </li>

  <li>Two handler for the same routes. </li>
</ul>

<p>You can refactor this in two separated methods. </p>

<p>In contrasts the new WCF Web Apis (current version of Jan-2011) has a very useful processors pipelines but you have to handle the Route + VERB in the same method.</p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer">http://feeds.feedburner.com/JoseFRomaniello<img width='1' height='1' src='http://joseoncodecom.ipage.com/wp-content/uploads/images/2935908889399243312-5906959921009337684' alt='' /></div>

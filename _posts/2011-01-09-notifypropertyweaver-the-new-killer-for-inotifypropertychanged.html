<p>I found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/notifypropertyweaver/">this project</a> several days ago. </p>  <p>This project uses <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil">Mono.Cecil</a> to “weave” your assemblies after compilation.</p>  <p>From the google code website you can see this example:</p>  <pre class="brush: csharp;">//Original
public class Person : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    public string GivenNames { get; set; }
    public string FamilyName { get; set; }

    public string FullName
    {
        get
        {
            return string.Format(&quot;{0} {1}&quot;, GivenNames, FamilyName);
        }
    }

}

//Weaved
public class Person : INotifyPropertyChanged
{

    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    private string givenNames;
    public string GivenNames
    {
        get { return givenNames; }
        set
        {
            if (value != givenNames)
            {
                givenNames = value;
                OnPropertyChanged(&quot;GivenNames&quot;);
                OnPropertyChanged(&quot;FullName&quot;);
            }
        }
    }

    private string familyName;
    public string FamilyName
    {
        get { return familyName; }
        set 
        {
            if (value != familyName)
            {
                familyName = value;
                OnPropertyChanged(&quot;FamilyName&quot;);
                OnPropertyChanged(&quot;FullName&quot;);
            }
        }
    }

    public string FullName
    {
        get
        {
            return string.Format(&quot;{0} {1}&quot;, GivenNames, FamilyName);
        }
    }

    public void OnPropertyChanged(string propertyName)
    {
        var propertyChanged = PropertyChanged;
        if (propertyChanged != null)
        {
            propertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>Some interesting points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It works on almost all versions of SL and WPF (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/notifypropertyweaver/wiki/SupportedRuntimesAndIde">read more</a>). </li>

  <li>It works if you already have a base class with any invoker method name (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/notifypropertyweaver/wiki/EventInvokerSelectionInjection">read more</a>).</li>

  <li>It has a very sophisticated algorithm to detect when it has to inject the invocation (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/notifypropertyweaver/wiki/HowPropertiesAreSelected">read more</a>).</li>

  <li>It show very useful information on the output console when you build the project.</li>

  <li>It doesn't need any reference to any assembly.</li>

  <li>You can tell the weaver to try to inject on any members of any type. (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/notifypropertyweaver/wiki/PropertyInclusion">read more</a>)</li>

  <li>You can tell explicitly in which properties you want the invocation (with an attribute and a reference that is removed after weaving).</li>

  <li>You can mix implicit and explicit mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been writing about automatically implementing INotifyPropertyChanged with DynamicProxy and there are other solutions like PostSharp, but I think this is the best option so far.</p>

<h2>Cons of the DynamicProxy version</h2>

<p>There are two main concerns with the DynamicProxy version:</p>

<ul>
  <li>WPF and Silverlight databinding infrastructure use a lot of reflection, with dynamicproxy sometimes things simply wont work. Marco Amendola wrote about some workarounds&#160; (<a href="http://marcoamendola.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/binding-to-an-interface-property-with-wpf/">link</a> <a href="http://marcoamendola.wordpress.com/2009/09/18/wpf-binding-to-a-windsor-proxied-component/">link</a>).</li>

  <li>DynamicProxy versions that I saw doesn’t handle readonly scenarios like FullName or does but in a very inefficient and complex way.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cons of the PostSharp version</h2>

<p>Like the DynamicProxy version, PostSharp versions that I saw, doesn’t handle readonly scenarios like FullName. I started a thread in the “Sharing Ideas” forum a on July of 2010, because I thought this was an important (and possible) feature to the framework, but the answer was that it wasn’t possible (<a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/forum/Topic4977-23-1.aspx">read the full thread here</a> surprisingly enough I gave they the same example that is in the NotifyPropertyWeaver main page). Gael Fraiteur said about an alternative approach, like having a code as follows:</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp;">public class Person
{
  [NotifyPropertyChanged(Dependants = &quot;FullName&quot;)]
  public string FirstName{get;set;}

  [NotifyPropertyChanged(Dependants = &quot;FullName&quot;)]
  public string LastName{get;set;}

  public string FullName
  {
    get{ return FirstName + &quot; &quot; + LastName; }
  }
}</pre>

<p>I’ve never used it, and I’ve never used PostSharp for INPC, because I don’t see any advantage compared the standard way in such cases.</p>

<p>Because PostSharp is a general purpose AOP framework and it can do a lot of things more than the NotifyPropertyWeaver, the weaved code may look unfamiliar and very complex. I don’t think it is inefficient or slow code, and it is not an issue for me, but I hear other people to say that.</p>

<h2>Finally</h2>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, PostSharp and DynamicProxy are both great frameworks and they are useful for lot of other things. I really like PostSharp as an AOP framework, using Mono.Cecil to modify your assemblies is not something than mortals like me can do on daily work, but I can implement a PostSharp aspect with few lines of code.</p>

<p>However my advice for INotifyPropertyChanged is to use this framework.</p>

<p>Kudos for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/SimonCropp">Simon Cropp</a> for the amazing work and for be willing to hear opinions about his project. I started to tweet about his project, and he immediately added me to twitter and gtalk. This says a lot about him and his commitment as an OSS project lead. </p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer">http://feeds.feedburner.com/JoseFRomaniello<img width='1' height='1' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/joseoncode.com/img/2935908889399243312-31365774326984989' alt='' /></div>

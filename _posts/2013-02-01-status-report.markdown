I have good news: I am not dead. 

I have been really quiet in this blog for a long time because I was not inspired to write and/or I didn't have anything important to share. Now I have lot of things to share but before that I just want to write about the last months.

I left Tellago 5 months ago. I was working with a really smart team in a very interesting project called [KidoZen][0]. I started this from day zero and I gave a lot of my time and effort to make it happen. The project is still going on and I prefer not to talk about why I left Tellago here.

The most important thing about my last project in Tellago is that it gave me a lot of experience in node.js, something I never used before. I contributed to various opensource things in node and I also write my stuff mostly because we needed to run KidoZen in Windows ([winser] [1] and [windows-eventlog] [2]).

After Tellago I took some time to try new ideas on my own, while I was looking for a more stable job. I had some very good job offers but I have to admit that I am very picky about jobs now. Which is bad because at the same time I need money to live and maintain a family :). 

After two months or so in this situation I found an amazing and talented group of people to work with. [Mat√≠as Woloski][3] was leaving SouthWorks and planning something with [Eugenio Pace][4]. They told me about their plans and it felt like a great people to work with. I enjoy every day I work with them and I am very thankful for having this opportunity.

So what are we up to? The company name is [Qraftlabs][5] which is a word that mix Quality, Craft and Lab and describes us very well. In the last few months we have been doing a little of consultancy and at the same time a new product which I think is looking great and going to be a success called [Auth0][6].

Auth0 make it easy for small startups to sell their services to companies. Lets say you have product which is an *issue tracker* and this product authenticate users through google, now suppose that bigcompany.com wants to use your product but they want/need their employees to use their @bigcompany.com accounts and they want to be able to share issues with their employees. Your product will have to support some weird combinations of identity providers like office365, adfs, google (apps), etc. and also be able to query these directories. Auth0 does this for you and we have prepared a lot of docs and samples about it. If your are interested in Auth0 follow [our blog][7] and [twitter][8].

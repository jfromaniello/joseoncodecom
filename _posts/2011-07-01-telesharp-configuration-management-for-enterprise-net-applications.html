<p><a href="http://tellagostudios.com/">Tellago Studios</a> the software development division of <a href="http://tellago.com/">Tellago</a> (the company I am working for), has released a new tool that address the configuration management challenges in .Net enterprise applications.</p>  <p>Whaaat? from <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cibrax/archive/2011/06/30/telesharp-an-application-repository-for-net-applications.aspx">Pablo Cibraroâ€™s blog</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Telesharp provides in a nutshell the following features,</p>    <p>1. <strong>Configure your application topology in a central repository</strong>. Application topology in this context means that you can decompose your application and describe it in terms of components and how they interact each other. For example, you can tell that the CRM system is made up of a couple of WCF services and a ASP.NET MVC front end.</p>    <p>2. <strong>Centralize configuration for your applications and components</strong>.&#160; You can import existing .NET configuration sections into the repository and associate them to the different components. In addition, environment overrides are supported for the configuration sections. We provide tooling and extensions in Visual Studio for managing all the configuration, and a set of powershell commands for automating the configuration deployment.</p>    <p>3. <strong>Browse all the assemblies and types remotely in your application servers in a web browser using an interface similar to any of the existing .NET reflection tools</strong>. You can easily determine this way whether the server is running the correct version of your applications.</p>    <p>4. <strong>Centralize logging and exception management into the repository</strong>. You get different reports and a pivot viewer experience for browsing all the different logging information generated by your applications. In addition, TeleSharp provides different providers for pushing the logging information to the central repository using well-known frameworks like ELMAH, Log4Net, EntLib or even Windows ETW.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I have not worked in this new product but we had two internals meetings about it and is looking <strong><u>really</u></strong> good. I think there are many companies out there looking for something like this.</p>  <p>Read more about TeleSharp here:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.tellagostudios.com/bringing-true-agility-enterprise-net-tellago-studios-announces-telesharp">Bringing true agility to enterprise .NET: Tellago Studios announces TeleSharp</a></li>    <li><a href="http://www.tellagostudios.com/telesharp-application-repository-net-applications">Telesharp - An Application Repository for .NET applications</a></li>    <li><a href="http://www.tellagostudios.com/why-net-configuration-management-sucks-and-what-can-you-do-about-it">Why .NET configuration management sucks and what can you do about it</a></li> </ul>  <p>You can also request a demo <a href="http://www.tellagostudios.com/products/telesharp%E2%84%A2">here</a> or <a href="http://www.regonline.com/Register/Checkin.aspx?EventID=989078">join us to a webinar</a> on Jul 06 to see the power of TeleSharp.</p>
